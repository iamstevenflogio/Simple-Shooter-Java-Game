Simple Shooter Java Game

Created my own mini game engine, to play with graphics using purely Java.
I thought of creating a player entity, created randomly spawning enemies, and the ability to shoot and change weapons.
Done for solo school project, to learn Object-Oriented and Event-Driven Programming.
