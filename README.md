Simple Shooter Java Game with simple Physics

Created my own mini game engine, to play with graphics using purely Java.
I thought of creating a player entity, created randomly spawning enemies, and the ability to shoot and change weapons.
Done for solo school project, to learn Object-Oriented and Event-Driven Programming.

I tried to create different varieties of enemies with my Java skills at the time,
so I created (1) an entity that follows the player around, while the others just bounce around at different speeds.
